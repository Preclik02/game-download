        Okay so this is pretty mutch my first game project I made in C++.<br>
        This game is cooked in low time and its pretty basic.<br>
        You just have to type some commands that are written in terminal.<br>
        This game is still in development.<br>
        I will made some type of support options in the future.<br>
        The GUI version is still yet to come and Im wotking on it.<br>
        I made this game just like to test my knowladge in C++.<br>
        I hope you enjoy this game.<br>
        I will give you some feedback on my github.<br>
    </p>
